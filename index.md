> In more than a decade of teaching physical computing at New York University’s Tisch
School of the Arts, we have found people from very **diverse backgrounds** looking to bridge
this gap between the physical and the virtual.

# .oxide.small[Why Should You Care?]

???
1. The Rust slogan has changed a lot throughout the years to now mainly highlight empowerment
---
class: middle,center

>  **Empowering everyone*** to build reliable and efficient software.
>
> ~ <cite>.oxide[The Rust Programming Language]</cite>



???
1. Empower: make (someone) stronger and more confident

---
class: middle, center

>  The Rust programming language is fundamentally about **empowerment**: no matter what kind of code you are writing now, Rust empowers you to **reach farther**, to program with confidence in **a wider variety of domains** than you did before.
>
> ~ <cite>.oxide[The Rust Programming Language Book]</cite>

???
1. Eliminate barriers
2. Flexibility: low level control or expressive high level features
3. Use skills to write drivers, OS, webapps
4. Rust runs on microcontrollers such as m-cortex to serverless services such as cloud lambda functions

1. Why physical computing
2. manipulation of abstract information
3. write code that is able to affect the real physical world is more engaging

> The computer is the Proteus of machines. Its essence is its universality, its **power to simulate**. Because it can take on a **thousand forms** and can serve a **thousand functions**, it can appeal to a **thousand tastes**.

# .oxide[How?]

---
class: center, middle
# Abstraction

???

1. Abstraction is a technique for hiding complexity that is irrelevant to
the problem in context
2. Machine language -> Assembly -> Programming language
3. Recurring patterns
